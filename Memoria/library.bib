   abstract = {This paper proposes a method which combines Sobel edge detection operator and soft-threshold wavelet de-noising to do edge detection on images which include White Gaussian noises. In recent years, a lot of edge detection methods are proposed. The commonly used methods which combine mean de-noising and Sobel operator or median filtering and Sobel operator can not remove salt and pepper noise very well. In this paper, we firstly use soft-threshold wavelet to remove noise, then use Sobel edge detection operator to do edge detection on the image. This method is mainly used on the images which includes White Gaussian noises. Through the pictures obtained by the experiment, we can see very clearly that, compared to the traditional edge detection methods, the method proposed in this paper has a more obvious effect on edge detection. © 2010 IEEE.},
